# WIP

Basic raycaster in the terminal. Current problems:

- Cannot handle multiple inputs due to ncurses limitations

- Does not work on Windows

On linux you need to install the ncurses package 
`sudo apt install libncurses-dev`
and then run `make`


Move around with WASD, turn with left and right arrow keys
