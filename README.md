Basic raycaster in the terminal

On linux you need to install the ncurses package 
`sudo apt install libncurses-dev`
and then run `make`

Windows will need MinGW to run the makefile. PDcurses lib is included in this repo so no need to install it manually.

Move around with WASD, turn with left and right arrow keys
